Good question. Here are some of the **common/native screen resolutions** for Apple Silicon Macs (desktops + laptops), plus some examples — and what “typical” scaled / UI-resolutions people often see. (Note: “Apple Silicon” covers M1, M2, M3, etc., but the displays are mostly similar across generations.)

### ✅ Common / Native Resolutions for Apple Silicon Macs

Here are some resolutions for prominent Apple Silicon machines:

| **Device / Category**                                                 | **Native / Reported Resolution**                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **13″ MacBook Air (M1)**                                              | **2560 × 1600** ([Apple][1])                             |
| **13″ MacBook Pro (M1)**                                              | **2560 × 1600** ([Distrelec Media][2])                   |
| **MacBook Air (M2, 13″)**                                             | **2560 × 1664** (per Wikipedia) ([Wikipedia][3])         |
| **MacBook Pro (14″, M1 Pro / Max)**                                   | **3024 × 1964** ([Wikipedia][4])                         |
| **MacBook Pro (16″, M1 Pro / Max)**                                   | **3456 × 2234** ([Wikipedia][4])                         |
| **iMac 24″ (M1)**                                                     | **4480 × 2520** (24″ “4.5K” Retina) ([Apple Support][5]) |
| **Apple Studio Display (external, commonly used with Apple Silicon)** | **5120 × 2880** (5K) ([Apple][6])                        |

## ⚠️ Notes on Scaled (“Looks Like”) Resolutions

* Many Apple Silicon MacBooks run in **scaled resolution** mode so that UI elements are more usable. For example, a 3024×1964 physical screen might be scaled to an effective resolution like *1800×1169* in “looks like” mode. ([Wikipedia][4])
* On Retina displays, “scale” doesn’t mean fewer pixels — it means the OS renders at a higher density and then maps UI so text / UI looks the right size while still being very sharp.

---

## 🔎 Key Take-Aways

* Apple Silicon laptops (Air / Pro) almost always use **high-resolution Retina panels** in the 2.5K to ~3.4K range (physical pixels), not low-res like many non-Retina laptops.
* The 24″ iMac is “4.5K” (4480×2520), which is much higher density than standard 1080p or even 1440p.
* For external displays, many Silicon Mac users go with **5K** displays (like the Studio Display), which can drive super high pixel densities and are a great match for macOS UI scaling.
